## Frontend Development Project 

In this project I have used HTML for structure, css for style to make Game more user intractive , JavaScript for functionality to make the Game more user intractive && Finally media query and bootstrap to make Game mobile responsive.

This Project/Game call Roll a Dice ðŸŽ². Its a Game of 2 Players!

### short Decription About Game && Functionality [To Test Play ](https://jas-sin82.github.io/roll_a_dice_game/)

* Click on a dice to play/roll ðŸŽ². <br>
* Game of 2 Players!! when the Player is active color = "light" & when Player is unactive color = "Dark" <br>
* Each Time you roll a ðŸŽ² will get different number between 1 to 6 !<br>
* Each move of ðŸŽ² will add points in your current score but except number 1.<br>
* when ever you will get 1 on dice this means Game will switch to other Player. <br>
* Any time you get 1 on dice you will lose your all current points, to protect your points ! You need to Hold
  your current score by clicking on rounded Hold button & push them in to
  Grand score. Grand total right under the Player Name by doing this your points are safe & beside you wait for
  your next move. <br>
* Hint to win game === Use Hold Button over and over again by doing this you transfer your current score
  in to grand score which means you have great chance to win. <br>
* To win Game ! Players need to get 50 points as fast as possible.<br>
* One more crucial information ! Once Players Start Play ! New Game Button will be unable to click ! which
  means you can't skip current Game before finish it. Once Player reach the score 50 && winner has decided at that time New Game button
  will enable to click to play again.<br>
* One more thing any time player want skip turn(dont want roll a dice ) just press hold button and game
  will pass to other Player.
